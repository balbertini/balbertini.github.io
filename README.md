# balbertini.github.io

This site is dedicated to the subjects that I usually teach at University of SÃ£o Paulo. Mostly, it includes HDL posts to help students to understand and properly use the language.

I decided to host it on GitHub to allow students to contribute using push request. If you want to make a contribution, please clone the source branch and modify the file that you want (or create one) on the content folder. After your modification, issue a push request and I'll do my best to incorporate your changes as soon as possible.

Regards,
Prof. Bruno Albertini
